# plantR logo ![](figs/plantR_logo.png){width=20%} 

This repository stores the code to build the logo of the [plantR package](https://github.com/LimaRAF/plantR). The package deals with download and cleaning of biodiversisty data. 

The logo was created using the [hexSticker package](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker) using the font [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins#standard-styles), a geometric sans serif typeface available under the [Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL).  

The pineapple icon was designed by Icons Producer and the computer icon, by Derrik Snider. Both icons are available under the [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) at [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com).
